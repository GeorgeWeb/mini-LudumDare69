----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This is my first Ludum Dare's entry game. 
It is created using my own 2D engine I called Pixels2D, developed in C++ using OpenGL and SDL. 
You can access the engine on: https://github.com/GeorgeWeb/Pixels2D 

The game's idea is simple. Alien invaders came to destroy the humankind but there he is Chuck Norris appearing as the last hope of all. Playing as Chuck you have to kill all aliens and prevent them from removing the mankind off the Earth. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
CONTROLS: 
- MOVEMENT: WASD or Arrow keys 
- SHOOTING: LEFT MOUSE BUTTON 
- WEAPON CHANGE: keys 1, 2 and 3 (the upper/top ones) 
  - `1` is a pistol, `2` is a shotgun, `3` is a machine gun

----------------------------------------------------------------------- 

If you WIN/LOSE instead of GUI indicators the game exits in the in command prompt(console) where it gives you stats on if you win or lose, how many humans/aliens you've killed and how many civilians remained in the end. On the next line it says: "Enter any key to quit..." so when you hit something on the keyboard and then press Enter the game will close. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Gotta say that it's an only Windows build... 
In order to run it, just unzip and click the .exe file. :) 

The development time of the game itself was about 3 days, while that version of the engine took me 2+ weeks. 

*UPDATE: For those who experience troubles with starting the game, read the following! Until I fix the issue with the error - missing MSVCP140.dll, you will need to download https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145 , the file you need is: vc_redist.x86.exe.
